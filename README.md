# Hotel Booking Analysis (Interactive Dashboard Creation using MS Excel)
## Objective

Why are there more family bookings than couple or single bookings?
## Questions
1.	Which month has the most cancellations, and why?
2.	Does guest type affect cancellations or no-shows for city vs resort hotels?
3.	Are bookings higher in certain seasons, and how can that help marketing?
4.	What share of room types get cancelled, and is it different for city and resort hotels?
5.	Do more bookings in busy months mean more cancellations or no-shows?
6.	How can knowing guest types help improve service at city and resort hotels?
7.	What can hotels do in busy months to reduce cancellations and no-shows?
8.	Are some guest types more likely to cancel at certain times of year?
9.	How do room type and booking outcome (check-out, cancel, no-show) connect for each guest type and hotel?
